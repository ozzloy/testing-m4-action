- or one of the following
  - `npm run test-auth`
  - `npm run test-spots`
  - `npm run test-reviews`
  - `npm run test-images`

## Running the Tests

To get the tests working, ensure you've configuired the following:

- Update the base url to point to your live site on Render or your local
  server.
- Ensure your server is running, or your live site is up and running.
- [`test/utils/constants`](./tests/utils/constants.mjs) is the only
  place you'll need to make a change.

Use `npm test` to run all of the tests. The test results will map
1-to-1 with your Scorecard.
